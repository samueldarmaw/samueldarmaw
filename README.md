Process Analysis: A Muse Me - Freelance Branding
My freelance branding for A Muse Me demonstrates my full design process from initial research to final polished marketing assets, aligning the workflow expected in a Graphic Designer role. The project began by creating the client’s brand identity and create visual materials suitable for digital presentations and early marketing campaigns.

I started by developing a color palette that suits client’s need, logo variations, and intended audience. The client needed a more cohesive and professional identity that could translate well across social media, product packaging, and pitch decks. To begin, I created multiple colour explorations in Adobe Illustrator, testing combinations for contrast, emotional tone, and brand alignment. Each iteration maintaining its aesthetic appeal with practical usability, ensuring the colours remained consistent across digital and print environments.

Once the colour pallate was finalized, I moved into producing high-quality visual mockups in Photoshop. I designed buisness cards, clothing tags, and shopping bags to help the client visualize how the updated branding would function in real-world marketing contexts. Throughout this stage, I iterated reworked typography scales, refining lighting in mockups, and adjusting spacing to maintain clarity and professionalism.

I maintained communication with the client, presenting each stage for feedback and integrating their preferences into the next iteration. The final package provided the client with a polished, unified visual identity and a set of ready-to-use marketing materials, strengthening their ability to pitch their brand effectively.

This project highlights my strengths in brand refinement, digital marketing asset creation, iterative design, and client-focused communication.
